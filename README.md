# CalmBot: Your Companion for Inner Peace üå±


**CalmBot** is an AI-powered emotional support platform designed to help users heal from unresolved trauma and find peace amid life‚Äôs chaos. Created for the **Peace with Oneself** challenge at Hackathon 2025, CalmBot helps individuals recognize, monitor, and begin to mend deep emotional wounds that often trace back to childhood pain or societal neglect.

Whether you're feeling happy, sad, angry, or anxious, CalmBot offers empathetic guidance, personalized actions, and a safe space for reflection. It supports your journey by fostering resilience and self-compassion.

Accessible through a responsive website and a Telegram bot, CalmBot gives users access to support anytime and anywhere. Powered by Google‚Äôs Gemini model and a custom learning system with adaptive memory, it responds with emotional awareness and continuously grows smarter from each interaction.

## üß† Problem Statement: Peace with Oneself

The **Peace with Oneself** challenge calls for solutions to help individuals heal from emotional distress and unresolved trauma, which often originate in childhood and are exacerbated by external chaos. CalmBot addresses this by:

- **Acknowledging Trauma:** Recognizes potential wounds (e.g., neglect, betrayal) with empathy, validating users‚Äô emotions.
- **Empowering Healing:** Offers actionable steps like journaling, breathing exercises, and mindfulness to process pain.
- **Building Resilience:** Motivates users to break cycles of avoidance and find strength in their journey.
- **Creating Calm:** Provides tools like the Serenity Garden and chat support to anchor users in peace.

CalmBot is more than a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a companion for those seeking to reclaim their emotional well-being and thrive.
