Problem Statement: Peace with Oneself

Empowering Healing: Offers actionable steps like journaling, breathing exercises, and mindfulness to process pain.
Building Resilience: Motivates users to break cycles of avoidance and find strength in their journey.
Creating Calm: Provides tools like the Serenity Garden and chat support to anchor users in peace.

CalmBot is more than a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a companion for those seeking to reclaim their emotional well-being and thrive.
