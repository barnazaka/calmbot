# CalmBot: Your Companion for Inner Peace üå±

**CalmBot** is an AI-powered emotional support platform designed to help users heal from unresolved trauma and find peace amidst life‚Äôs chaos. Built for the **Peace with Oneself** problem statement at Hackathon 2025, CalmBot empowers individuals to recognize, monitor, and mend deep-rooted emotional wounds, often stemming from childhood hurts or societal neglect.

Whether you‚Äôre feeling happy, sad, angry, or anxious, CalmBot offers empathetic guidance, personalized actions, and a safe space to reflect‚Äîfostering resilience and self-compassion.

Accessible via a responsive website and a Telegram bot, CalmBot ensures users can seek support anytime, anywhere. Powered by Google‚Äôs Gemini model and a custom learning model with adaptive memory, CalmBot delivers trauma-aware responses and grows smarter by learning from user interactions.

## üß† Problem Statement: Peace with Oneself

The **Peace with Oneself** challenge calls for solutions to help individuals heal from emotional distress and unresolved trauma, which often originate in childhood and are exacerbated by external chaos. CalmBot addresses this by:

- **Acknowledging Trauma:** Recognizes potential wounds (e.g., neglect, betrayal) with empathy, validating users‚Äô emotions.
- **Empowering Healing:** Offers actionable steps like journaling, breathing exercises, and mindfulness to process pain.
- **Building Resilience:** Motivates users to break cycles of avoidance and find strength in their journey.
- **Creating Calm:** Provides tools like the Serenity Garden and chat support to anchor users in peace.

CalmBot is more than a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a companion for those seeking to reclaim their emotional well-being and thrive.
